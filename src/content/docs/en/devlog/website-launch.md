description: "Devlog Documentation"

I have tried a couple of documentation tools for planning; but every choice I tried felt like a **hassle** more than a helpful guide for my game development process.

So I started thinking about what I actually want from this **documentation process**. I want :

- [ ] Terminology Dictionary
- [ ] Data Distribution & Analytics
- [ ] Progress Tracking
- [ ] Game Wiki
- [ ] Scope Awareness
- [ ] Public Feedback
- [ ] Future Roadmap

I am not going to bore you with what these goals mean for me; but after having a good look at these goals, I realized that a personal website would suit me the best.

## Terminology Dictionary

What **things** are called **what** in the game? And do they **make sense** in the **overall picture**?

What is an equipment, what is a battle entity and so on?

Now that I have to write an explanation in this documentation, I will validate my code structure and decisions.

If it doesn't make sense in this documentation, it doesn't make sense for the game as well.

And that calls for a revision.

## Data Distribution & Analytics

I work as a digital analytics lead in real life, so I would like to do a couple of cool things on how I track my players. And those cool things I mention would require having my own site.

This website will also allow me to create custom endpoints for my own API Routes. I will be able to use it as distributor for my database files. Update it once on the site and use

Since the data is also parsed by the site to generate the documentation, this will be a testing/validation step for the files as well.

## Web Framework

None of the goals I described above required a lot of page interactivity. I needed a framework that is focused on documenting stuff which consists of statically generated pages.

I reviewed a couple of documentation focused **JavaScript frameworks** and eventually decided on [Astro](https://astro.build/). Looks promising and fun to use.

I have no experience as a web developer, but looks like this [framework's documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) is quite informative which is one of the reasons I will go with it. 

If you are reading this, it looks like I managed to do so : )
